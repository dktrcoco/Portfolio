          <h2>General</h2>

          <p>My name is Chris. I live in Chicago. I'm left handed and proud of it. My academic and professional career up to this point has been focused on chemistry; 
            specifically organic chemistry and the chemistry of what goes on during jet fuel oxidation. This pandemic has changed a lot, 
            including my life. I am now looking at developing my skills as a coder/web developer.</p>

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        
        <p>I enjoy cooking for me and my wife. It's fun to try new recipes! I love traveling: my wife and I have been to Ireland, 
          Australia, and Hawaii (as well as other less exciting domestic locations). I love playing racquetball. I have played many times 
          in the state tournaments in PA and IL. I like to work out, both strength training as well as things like Pilates. I'm also an avid 
          gamer (PC, PS, Nintendo). My favorite game for each is probably WoW, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Breath of the Wild, respectively.</p>

          <h2>Books/Movies</h2>
       
        <p>I love reading. Some of my favorites are in the fantasy genre, such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, 
          anything by Brandon Sanderson, The Harry Dresden Files. I also love just about anything by Stephen King. As far as movies go, I love The Matrix (yes, even the sequels), The Martian (the book too!), Lord of the Rings, the MCU, Star Wars. The magic 
          of the internet has blurred the line between movies and TV so I'll list my favorite shows as well. Game of Thrones, Westworld, The Simpsons, 
          Rick and Morty, Breaking Bad.</p>
